# Comments

## Just like most modern languages, Kotlin supports single-line (or end-of-line) and multi-line (block) comments.

// This is an end-of-line comment

/* This is a block comment
on multiple lines. */

## Block comments in Kotlin can be nested.

/* The comment starts here
/* contains a nested comment *⁠/
and ends here. */
